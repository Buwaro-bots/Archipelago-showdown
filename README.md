A manual Archipelago world I made for a friend.
There are 32 checks for Randbat, OU, UU, Double OU and Double UU.
Double UU can be replaced with RU. RU pokémons can be specifically unlocked if you want to play RU.

Can't be played on the official Archipelago discord but eh. ¯\_(ツ)\_/¯

If you read this and are interested to play, and I forgot to make a release:
- Download the whole folder.
- Take the yaml from the yaml folder.
- Zip the whole folder, name it "manual_pokemon_showdown_buwaro.apworld", and put it in the lib/worlds folder of your Archipelago installation.

Keys don't do anything, it's just how I made sure too many games weren't necessary for the early spheres.
